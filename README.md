# Bootstrap Notify
This is a simple pluging that turns standard Bootstrap alerts into "Growl-like" notifications.

## Bower Officially Supported
I would like to thank [Błażej Krysiak](https://github.com/IjinPL) for doing this!
```
bower install remarkable-bootstrap-notify 
```

## Composer installation
``
composer require mouse0270/bootstrap-growl
```
